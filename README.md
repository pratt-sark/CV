PROJECT TITLE : My Curriculum Vitae using HTML and CSS

AUTHOR: Pratyay Sarkar

There are a few reasons to add to this README file, otherwise the project title itself is self-explanatory.

1) The HTML Script in index.html is not properly indented (I'll explain why, in the following points).

2) I had some alignment issues early on in the project, which I kind of 'duct-taped' using 'pre' tag (which preserves alignment)
leading to my script being poorly indented. It didn't occur to me then, that 'padding' was an actual option in Inline CSS.

3) In my later scripting sessions, I used padding wherever possible, but still kept the earlier messy script. It was too tedious
work to go back and fix my unaligned script with conventional techniques. However, THE WEBSITE IS AS IT SHOULD BE. In other words,
I followed the saying "If it works, it works!" :)

4) I am not fully aware of each CSS Styling used in this project, as I took liberty to surf the net for some solutions I just 
wasn't aware of (in the period of time I invested in). 

5) I used some icons from a website: www.fontawesome.com . It has a really massive collection of icons ready to be used in a webpage
with just a few lines of script! Their paid version offers much more options, but the free one is a gold-mine nevertheless.

And in case anyone is interested:
Text Editor Used: VS Code (aided by a few HTML and CSS extensions, makes life much easier)

Thanks for reading..
